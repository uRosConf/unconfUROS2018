# unconfUROS
The annual [conference on the use of R in official statistics](https://www.aanmelder.nl/uros2018) will take place on the premises of Statistics Netherlands September 12-14. We are excited to announce an unconference use of R in official statistics on the two days just before the uRos conference.

## Motivation
The idea behind the event (similar to http://unconf17.ropensci.org/ for R in general) to bring together useRs from the area of official statistics to work for two days on concrete projects where enhancements would benefit many institutes, organisation,... .

At this moment, we are at the stage of collecting ideas about concrete needs in the area and then try to model them into projects. Projects can relate to open data, data vizualization, data publication and of course statistical data production (such as survey methodology, editing, imputation, disclosure control, ...).

Similar to the idea of the [awesome official statistics software](http://www.awesomeofficialstatistics.org) list, this should complement an abstract top-down approach such as the [common statistical production architecture](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/CSPA/CSPA+v1.5) with fast bottom-up solutions.

## Presentation

The results of unconfUROS will be presented during the ensuing uRos2018 conference.

## Ideas

 - [Machine learning techniques for imputation (boosting, deep learning, ....)](doc/MLimputation.md)
 - [A shiny app for data validation and rule management](doc/data_validation.md)
 - Sampling package that covers the need of NSIs
 - A shiny app for statistical disclosure control of tabular data (using [sdcTable](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sdcTable))
 - [A categorical variable that satisfies needs of NSI's](doc/categorical.md)
 - [A shiny app that visualizes an interactive price kaleidoscope](doc/price_kaleidoscope.md)
